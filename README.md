# QuantBioClass
A set of tutorials I made for an undergrad statistics I taught in University of Oklahoma in the fall of 2017. These tutorials are made in R . This is basically statistics class for biologists. So it has a lot of biological examples for ANOVA, t tests, chi square tests for a sophomore level undergraduate student.
